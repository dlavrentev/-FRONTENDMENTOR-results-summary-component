- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) - React Framework


### What I learned

This time I learned how to fetch data from a JSON file located on another file in the project. I also learned more about useState and useEffect on this project. Mapping trough the data was also fun!

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch("/public/data/data.json");
      const data = await response.json();
      setSkillCategories(data);
    };
    fetchData();
  }, []);
```

```jsx 
<div className="skills-container">
            {skillCategories.map((skill) => (
              <div className={`skill ${skill.skillClass}`} key={skill.category}>
                <div>
                  <img src={skill.icon} alt={skill.category} />
                  <p className="skill-name">{skill.category}</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                  <span className="score">{skill.score}</span> / 100
                </p>
              </div>
            ))}
          </div>
```




### Continued development

Next time I want to add the CSS extension language Sass. Because my current CSS code is a little bit messy (but commented). I hope i can bring a little bit more structure into it next time.


### Useful resources

- [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) Solid resource I use in almost every project. I looked up fetching data on this project.
